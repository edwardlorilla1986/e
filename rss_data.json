        "description": "<p>Vatican City \u2014 Pope Francis's condition was continuing to improve, the Vatican said Thursday, as the 88-year-old pontiff marked two weeks in hospital with pneumonia in both lungs.</p>\n\n<p>\"The clinical conditions of the Holy Father are confirmed to be improving today also,\" said the Vatican in an evening bulletin on the pope's health.</p>\n\n<p>It was the second consecutive day the Vatican cited an improvement in the critical condition of the Argentine pope, who was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14.</p>\n\n<p>As pilgrims and other well-wishers continue to gather to pray and leave offerings outside the hospital, medical experts -- together with the Vatican -- have warned that Francis is not out of danger.</p>\n\n<p>\"Given the complexity of the clinical picture, further days of clinical stability are necessary to resolve the prognosis,\" the Vatican statement said.</p>\n\n<p>After first being admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties, the Vatican revealed that the pope -- who had part of a lung removed as a young man -- had double pneumonia.</p>\n\n<p>But on Wednesday, it said that Francis's clinical conditions had shown a \"slight improvement\" while cautioning that his prognosis remained \"reserved\".</p>\n\n<p>A respiratory attack Francis suffered at the weekend that required high levels of oxygen has not been repeated, although he continues to receive oxygen and do breathing exercises.</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, he \"alternated high-flow oxygen therapy with a venturi mask,\" the Vatican said, referring to an oxygen mask that delivers oxygen at controlled concentrations.</p>\n\n<p>\"In the morning, the Holy Father dedicated his time to respiratory physiotherapy, alternating it with rest,\" said the Vatican.</p>\n\n<p>In the afternoon, following another session of therapy, he prayed in the chapel located on the 10th floor of the Gemelli in the special papal suite, said the Vatican. He then spent time working, it said.</p>\n\n<p>The pope's latest improvement comes after his deteriorating condition at the weekend sparked fears that the head of the world's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics might not pull through.</p>\n\n<p>Doctors have warned the path to recovery could be long, with the Jesuit pontiff likely staying in hospital beyond this week.</p>\n\n<p>Among those praying for the health of Francis Thursday were a group of Mexican pilgrims, who paid a visit to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>\"Today we go back to Mexico and we wanted before we leave to come and see where he is. It doesn't matter if we only see the window, but we also wanted to say some prayers,\" a teary Lili Iparrea Fernandez, 74, told AFP.</p>\n\n<p>\"We would like to go in to kiss his feet,\" said another pilgrim, Flor Mercado Garcia, 66.</p>\n\n<p>Garcia brought an offering of yellow flowers for Francis, but ended up placing it at the feet of the statue of John Paul II in front of the hospital, amid the growing mass of candles, drawings, and messages of support.</p>\n\n<p>'Not there yet'</p>\n\n<p>Francesco Blasi, head of pneumology at Milan Polyclinic, and Stefania Vaglio, director of the Immune-hematology unit at the Sant'Andrea Polyclinic in Rome, said the pope's prognosis remains reserved because \"the respiratory problem has not been resolved.</p>\n\n<p>\"For an 88-year-old who was already suffering from a chronic respiratory disease before the pneumonia, (his condition) remains critical at least until the improvement is defined as stable,\" they said in a joint interview with the Corriere della Sera daily.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are not there yet. More days of waiting are needed\".</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, the \"respiratory physiotherapy\" Francis is doing is key for patients with severe pneumonia, Blasi and Vaglio said.</p>\n\n<p>The exercises help them learn how to best use the muscles involved in breathing, they added.</p>\n\n<p>At 14 days so far, this current hospitalization is Francis's longest.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his critical condition, Francis has kept up with Church matters from his hospital suite.</p>\n\n<p>\"The pope wants to push through decisions he cares about, it is a manifestation of strength, of a willingness to govern,\" Adriano Prosperi, a historian specialized in the Church, told the Repubblica daily.</p>\n\n<p>Elected in 2013, Francis has aroused both fervor and fury within the Church with reforms aimed at opening the doors of a centuries-old institution to the modern-day faithful.</p>\n\n<p>\"Francis knows that what he leaves behind is in danger, and wants to protect it\", Prosperi said.</p>",

This limited its ability to generate solar power and prevented it from completing NASA experi-ments under a $118-million contract.</p>\n\n<p>This time, the price tag is $62.5 million.</p>\n\n<p>Martin said the company had made key improvements \u2014 including better cabling for the laser altime-ter, an instrument that provides altitude and velocity readings and helps select a safe landing site.</p>\n\n<p>Athena's arrival at the moon is set to be preceded on March 2 by another private US lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, which launched on a more circuitous journey back in January, sharing a ride with Tokyo-based ispace's Resilience lander.</p>\n\n<p>Also hitching a ride on this rocket will be NASA's Lunar Trailblazer probe, which will enter orbit after a four-month journey and begin a two-year mission to study the distribution of different forms of water on the moon.</p>",

The actions at USAID leave only a fraction of its employees on the job.</p>\n\n<p>Trump and Musk have moved swiftly to shutter the foreign aid agency, calling its programs out of line with the president's agenda and asserting without evidence that its work is wasteful. In addition to its scope, their effort is extraordinary because it has not involved Congress, which authorized the agency and has provided its funding.</p>\n\n<p>A report from the Congressional Research Service earlier this month said congressional authorization is required \"to abolish, move, or consolidate USAID,\" but the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have made no pushback against the administration's actions. There's virtually nothing left to fund, anyway: The administration now says it is eliminating more than 90 percent of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in US assistance around the world.</p>\n\n<p>It's unclear how many of the more than 5,600 USAID employees who have been fired or placed on leave work at the agency's headquarters building in Washington. A notice on the agency's website said staff at other locations will have the chance to collect their personal belongings at a later date.</p>\n\n\nRetired United States Agency for International Development worker Julie Hanson Swanson (left) join supporters of USAID workers outside the USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian affairs office in Washington, Friday, Feb. 21, 2025. AP PHOTO\n\n\n<p>The notice laid out instructions for when specific groups of employees should arrive to be screened by security and escorted to their former workspaces. Those being let go must turn in all USAID-issued assets. Workers on administrative leave were told to retain their USAID-issued materials, including diplomatic passports, \"until such time that they are separated from the agency.\"</p>\n\n<p>Many USAID workers saw the administration's terms for retrieving their belongings as insulting. In the notice, the employees were instructed not to bring weapons, including firearms, \"spear guns\" and \"hand grenades.\" Each worker is being given just 15 minutes at their former workstation.</p>\n\n<p>The administration's efforts to slash the federal government are embroiled in various lawsuits, but court challenges to temporarily halt the shutdown of USAID have been unsuccessful.</p>\n\n<p>However, a federal judge on Tuesday gave the Trump administration a deadline of this week to release billions of dollars in US foreign aid, saying it had given no sign of complying with his nearly two-week-old court order to ease the funding freeze. Late Wednesday, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked that order, with Chief Justice John Roberts saying it will remain on hold until the high court has a chance to weigh in more fully.</p>\n\n<p>That court action resulted from a lawsuit filed by nonprofit organizations over the cutoff of foreign assistance through USAID and the State Department. Trump froze the money through an executive order on his first day in office that targeted what he portrayed as wasteful programs that do not correspond to his foreign policy goals.</p>\n\n<p>Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly said in a statement that the attack on USAID employees was \"unwarranted and unprecedented.\" Connolly, whose district includes a sizable federal workforce, called the aid agency workers part of the \"world's premier development and foreign assistance agency\" who save \"millions of lives every year.\"</p>",

        "description": "<p>A US company is aiming for its second lunar touchdown after a lander carrying a suite of unique experiments successfully launched aboard a SpaceX rocket on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Intuitive Machines made history last year as the first private entity to put a robot on the Moon, though the triumph was marred by the lander tipping onto its side -- something it hopes to avoid this time around.</p>\n\n<p>The Houston-based firm's hexagonal-shaped lander, Athena, blasted off in a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 7:16 pm (0016 GMT Thursday) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>If all goes well, it will touch down around March 6 at the vast Mons Mouton plateau, a site closer to the lunar south pole than any previously targeted.</p>\n\n<p>Athena carries scientific instruments, including a drill to search for ice beneath the surface and a first-of-its-kind hopping drone named Grace after a famous computer scientist, Grace Hopper.</p>\n\n<p>It is designed to traverse the Moon's rugged inclines, boulders, and craters -- a valuable capability to support future crewed missions.</p>\n\n<p>Also aboard is a small rover, which will test a lunar cellular network provided by Nokia Bell Labs by relaying commands, images, and video between the lander, rover, and hopper. This network is planned to eventually be integrated into astronauts' suits.</p>\n\n<p>Intuitive Machines CEO Trent Martin spoke excitedly about the hopper, emphasizing that such drones could complement rovers in future missions by going \"down into extreme environments where you can't drive,\" including lunar pits and underground passages carved by ancient lava flows.</p>\n\n<p>Until recently, soft lunar landings were achieved only by a handful of well-funded national space agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the US is working to make private missions routine through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, a public-private collaboration aimed at delivering NASA hardware to the surface at a fraction of the cost of traditional missions.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm very excited to see the science that our tech demonstrations deliver as we prepare for humanity's return to the Moon and the journey to Mars,\" NASA's Nicky Fox told reporters, referencing the Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade.</p>\n\n<p>Sticking the landing </p>\n\n<p>First, however, Intuitive Machines will want to achieve an upright landing -- a feat the company fell short of with its previous lander, Odysseus, which went to space in February 2024.</p>\n\n<p>It came down too fast, caught a foot on the surface and tipped over, coming to rest at a 30-degree angle. This limited its ability to generate solar power and prevented it from completing NASA experiments under a $118 million contract.</p>\n\n<p>This time, the price tag is $62.5 million.</p>\n\n<p>Landing on the Moon is challenging due to the absence of an atmosphere, which rules out the use of parachutes.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, spacecraft must rely on precisely controlled thruster burns to slow their descent while navigating treacherous terrain.</p>\n\n<p>Martin said the company had made key improvements -- including better cabling for the laser altimeter, an instrument that provides altitude and velocity readings and helps select a safe landing site.</p>\n\n<p>Athena's arrival at the Moon is set to be preceded on March 2 by another private US lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, which launched on a more circuitous journey back in January, sharing a ride with Tokyo-based ispace's Resilience lander.</p>\n\n<p>Also hitching a ride on this rocket will be NASA's Lunar Trailblazer probe, which will enter orbit after a four-month journey and begin a two-year mission to study the distribution of different forms of water on the Moon.</p>\n\n<p>These missions come at a delicate time for NASA, amid speculation that it may scale back or cancel its astronaut program to the Moon in favor of Mars -- a key goal of both President Donald Trump and his close advisor Elon Musk, SpaceX tycoon.</p>",

        "description": "<p>VIENNA \u2014 Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium as tensions between Tehran and Washington rise after the election of US President Donald Trump, a report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog seen by The Associated Press on Wednesday showed.</p>\n\n<p>The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Feb. 8, Iran has 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%. That's an increase of 92.5 kilograms (203.9 pounds) since the IAEA's last report in November.</p>\n\n<p>That material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.</p>\n\n<p>A report in November 2024 put the stockpile at 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds). It had 164.7 kilograms (363.1 pounds) last August.</p>\n\n<p>\"The significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon State to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,\" the confidential report stated. According to the IAEA, approximately 42 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb, if enriched further to 90%.</p>\n\n<p>The IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Feb. 8, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds), which represents an increase of 1,690.0 kilograms (3725.8 pounds) since the last report in November.</p>\n\n<p>Trump administration warns TehranThe Trump administration said Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n<p>\"President Trump has put the Iran Regime on notice by reimposing Maximum Pressure and is committed to ensuring the regime never gets a nuclear weapon. He has also made clear he is open to talks with Iran to come to an agreement that fully addresses the outstanding issues between our two countries,\" National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said.</p>\n\n<p>Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018 he unilaterally withdrew the US from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling the economy, and ordered the killing of the country's top general.</p>\n\n<p>Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms.</p>\n\n<p>Iran's accelerated production of near weapons-grade uranium puts more pressure on Trump as he's repeatedly said he's open to negotiations with the Islamic Republic while also increasingly targeting Iran's oil sales with sanctions as part of his reimposed \"maximum pressure\" policy.</p>\n\n<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in August opened the door to talks with the US, saying there is \"no harm\" in engaging with the \"enemy.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, more recently he tempered that, saying that negotiations with America \"are not intelligent, wise or honorable\" after Trump floated nuclear talks with Tehran.</p>\n\n<p>\"Regarding the nuclear negotiations, the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear. We will not negotiate under pressure, threat or sanctions,\" Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday during a press conference with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.</p>\n\n<p>Iran's mission at the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>IAEA inspectors banned as Iran begins operating more centrifugesIran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \"several\" nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Iranian officials have increasingly suggested Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. US intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \"undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\"</p>\n\n<p>The IAEA already warned last December that Iran was poised to \"quite dramatically\" increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started operating cascades of advanced centrifuges.</p>\n\n<p>That move came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA passing a resolution condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In the past, Iran has repeatedly responded to the board's resolutions by further enhancing its nuclear program.</p>\n\n<p>Wednesday's report also said that Iran has also not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to ban some of the agency's most experienced inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Director General deeply regrets that Iran, despite having indicated a willingness to consider accepting the designation of four additional experienced Agency inspectors, did not accept their designations,\" the report said.</p>\n\n<p>Unanswered questions remain, despite 2023 dealAdditionally, the report says that \"no progress was made towards resolving the outstanding safeguards issues in relations to Varamin and Turquzabad,\" the two locations in Iran where the nuclear watchdog has questions about the origin and location of man-made uranium particles found there.</p>\n\n<p>The report also said that Grossi held telephone discussions with Araghchi at the beginning of this year, during which he \"reiterated his readiness to work with Iran to resume implementation\" of a deal the agency and Tehran agreed two years ago.</p>\n\n<p>The Joint Statement included a pledge by Iran to resolve issues around Varamin and Turquzabad, where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \"implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Foreign Minister Araghchi indicated Iran's preparedness to cooperate with the Agency and raised the possibility of the Director General visiting Tehran again,\" the report said.</p>\n\n<p>The IAEA report also said the agency verified that Tehran had increased the number of operating cascades of advanced centrifuges, powerful machines that spin rapidly to enrich uranium. Cascades are clusters of centrifuges.</p>\n\n<p>The report said Iran had increased the number of IR-6 centrifuges by 5 to a total of 7 at its underground nuclear plant at Fordo.</p>\n\n<p>The nuclear watchdog also verified that Iran had increased the number of operating cascades of IR-2m centrifuges by 12 to a total of 27 at its underground nuclear plant in Natanz.</p>\n\n<p>Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium to only 3.67% with a limited number of its first-generation centrifuges at the underground Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant only.</p>\n\n<p>The more advanced model of centrifuges that Iran is using now enrich uranium at a much faster pace than the baseline IR-1 centrifuges.</p>",

        "description": "<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Elon Musk took a star turn at the first Cabinet meeting of President Donald Trump's new term, holding forth in a black \"Make America Great Again\" campaign hat on Wednesday about his role as \"humble tech support\" for the federal government \u2014 and laying out dire stakes if his cost-cutting efforts fail.\"If we don't do this, America will go bankrupt,\" Musk told department heads assembled around a large wooden table in the Cabinet Room.Trump, not one to easily share the spotlight, seemed happy to turn the top of the hour-plus meeting over to Musk for a \"little summary\" of what the Department of Government Efficiency has been up to, saying that Musk's team had found evidence of \"horrible things\" afoot in the government.\"He's sacrificing a lot,\" Trump said of Musk, referencing the time the world's richest man is taking away from his many business ventures. \"He's also getting hit.\"Musk, for his part, said his lightning-fast efforts to right-size the government had drawn death threats and he jokingly knocked his fist on his \"wooden head\" as he said he hoped to find $1 trillion to trim from the federal budget, an effort that has caused extensive disruption among federal workers and those who rely on their services.Musk defended his weekend attempt to require government workers to justify their prior week's work under penalty of termination \u2014 a move that drew pushback from many in the room on national security and privacy grounds \u2014 as merely a \"pulse check\" to ensure that those working for the government have \"a pulse and two neurons,\" adding that \"this is not a high bar\" for workers to meet.Speculating that some workers are either dead or fictional, Musk added that the goal was to see that workers are real, alive and can \"write an email.\"Asked if members of the Cabinet were happy with Musk, the DOGE guru started to answer the question. But Trump interjected and said he might want to let Cabinet members answer. Then Trump joked that if anyone disagreed, he might \"throw them out.\"That drew applause from Cabinet members.Trump then turned things back to Musk, who said the president had \"put together, I think, the best Cabinet ever.\"\"And I don't give false praise,\" he added.Musk did volunteer that his efforts to slash government spending would \"make mistakes.\"He cited as an example that, while hustling to dramatically shrink the US Agency for International Development, \"One of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention.\" Musk insisted that \"there was no interruption\" in services before the funding was restored.But a USAID official said Wednesday that no funds for the agency's Ebola response had been released under President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 funding freeze for foreign aid, including for efforts to combat the spread of the deadly virus.After about 15 minutes of focus on Musk and DOGE, Trump shifted the spotlight of the Cabinet meeting back to his own accomplishments in his first weeks in office.The Cabinet sat mostly silently for more than an hour, as Trump opened the floor to questions from an invited group of reporters.Asked if he expected his Cabinet to follow his directives without exception, Trump initially scoffed at the question before answering, \"of course, no exceptions.\"</p>",

        "description": "<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 The US government is facing a generational realignment as President Donald Trump directs federal agencies to develop plans for eliminating employee positions and consolidating programs.</p>\n\n<p>Senior officials set the downsizing in motion on Wednesday with a memo that dramatically expands Trump's efforts to scale back a workforce described as an impediment to his agenda. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're cutting down the size of government. We have to,\" Trump said during the first Cabinet meeting of his second term. \"We're bloated. We're sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren't doing their job.\"</p>\n\n<p>The ripple effects will be felt around the country. Roughly 80% of federal workers live outside the Washington area, and government services \u2014 patent approvals, food inspections, park maintenance and more \u2014 could be hindered depending on how cuts are handled.</p>\n\n<p>Resistance is expected. Labor unions, Democratic state leaders and other organizations have tried, with some success, to slow Trump down with litigation, while Republicans are growing more concerned about how a slash-and-burn strategy could affect their constituents.</p>\n\n<p>\"Once you do this damage, it's going to be incredibly hard to rebuild the capacity of these organizations,\" said Don Moynihan, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan. \"It's not like you can turn the switch back on and everything is going to be the way it was before.\"</p>\n\n<p>Agencies are directed to submit by March 13 their plans for what is known as a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate the position altogether. The result could be extensive changes in how government functions.</p>\n\n<p>No specific targets for cutbacks were included in the memo. However, as an example, Trump said the Environmental Protection Agency could reduce its staff by 65%.</p>\n\n<p>More plans are due on April 14, when agencies are expected to outline how they will consolidate management, become more efficient and potentially relocate offices to parts of the country that are less expensive than Washington. The memo said agencies have a Sept. 30 deadline for implementation.</p>\n\n<p>Administration officials framed their effort as a cost-saving measure with a clear ideological goal.</p>\n\n<p>\"The federal government is costly, inefficient, and deeply in debt. At the same time, it is not producing results for the American public,\" said the memo from Russell Vought, director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, and Charles Ezell, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, which functions as a human resources agency. \"Instead, tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups while hurting hard-working American citizens.\"</p>\n\n<p>Vought was an author of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump's second term, and he has advocated for centralizing power under the presidency and dismantling federal bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're not going to save our country without a little confrontation,\" Vought said last summer during a podcast hosted by Trump ally Stephen Bannon.</p>\n\n<p>Moynihan described the memo as a \"backdoor way\" of reducing the size of government since Congress hasn't passed any legislation to cut programs.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's a fundamental realignment of power here,\" he said. \"This administration is saying we have much more power than any previous administration when it comes to deciding how government works.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kevin Owen, an employment lawyer who represents federal workers, compared the administration's initiative to the kind of disruptions that are caused by government shutdowns during congressional budget standoffs.</p>\n\n<p>\"This looks like a plan for a significant and shocking reduction of the federal workforce that I don't think the American people are prepared for,\" Owen said. \"It's going to cripple a lot of government functions.\"</p>\n\n<p>He said that Trump and his allies were focusing on speed rather than precision as they overhaul the government.</p>\n\n<p>\"Their plan is to do the damage and get sued,\" he said. If a court ultimately rules against them, \"by that point, they would have gotten what they wanted in interim.\"</p>\n\n<p>Trump foreshadowed the effort in a recent executive order that he signed with Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who oversees the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The order said agency leaders \"shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force,\" or RIF.</p>\n\n<p>Some departments have already begun this process. The General Services Administration, which handles federal real estate, told employees on Monday that a reduction in force was underway and they would do \"everything in our power to make your departure fair and dignified.\"</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement, national security, public safety, military positions and US Postal Service positions are exempt.</p>\n\n<p>The memo was released shortly before Trump convened Cabinet officials as well as Musk, who attended the meeting wearing a black \"Make America Great Again\" campaign hat.</p>\n\n<p>Musk described himself during the meeting as \"humble tech support\" for the federal government, and he talked about his cost-cutting crusade in existential terms.</p>\n\n<p>\"If we don't do this, America will go bankrupt,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Musk has caused turmoil within the federal workforce, most recently by demanding that employees justify their jobs or risk getting fired. OPM later said that the edict was voluntary, although workers could face similar requests in the future.</p>\n\n<p>He described his request as a \"pulse check.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Are these people real? Are they alive? And can they write an email?\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Before the meeting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that \"all of the Cabinet secretaries take the advice and direction of DOGE.\"</p>\n\n<p>Musk's operation became more powerful on Wednesday with a new executive order signed by Trump. He directed agencies to develop new systems for distributing and justifying payments so they could be monitored by DOGE representatives. Employee travel is being limited and agency credit cards are being frozen unless they're used for disaster relief or supervisors create an exception.</p>\n\n<p>The order said government workers must be \"accountable to the American public.\"</p>",

        "description": "<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 The Trump administration said Wednesday it is eliminating more than 90% of the US Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall US assistance around the world, putting numbers on its plans to eliminate the majority of US development and humanitarian help abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles with the administration.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Wednesday's disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administration's retreat from US aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of US policy that foreign aid helps US interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.</p>\n\n<p>The memo said officials were \"clearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift.\" More changes are planned in how USAID and the State Department deliver foreign assistance, it said.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money.</p>\n\n<p>Trump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight.</p>\n\n<p>The funding freeze has stopped thousands of US-funded programs abroad, and the administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings.</p>\n\n<p>In the federal court filings Wednesday, nonprofits owed money on contracts with USAID describe both Trump political appointees and members of Musk's teams terminating USAID's contracts around the world at breakneck speed, without time for any meaningful review, they say.</p>\n\n<p>\"'There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!''' a USAID official wrote staff Monday, in an email quoted by lawyers for the nonprofits in the filings.</p>\n\n<p>The nonprofits, among thousands of contractors, owed billions of dollars in payment since the freeze began, called the en masse contract terminations a maneuver to get around complying with the order to lift the funding freeze temporarily.</p>\n\n<p>So did a Democratic lawmaker.</p>\n\n<p>\"The administration is brazenly attempting to blow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham 'review' of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world,\" said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>\n\n<p>The State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations.</p>\n\n<p>In all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of $54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of $4.4 billion.</p>\n\n<p>The State Department memo, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administration's monthlong block on foreign aid funding.</p>\n\n<p>\"In response, State and USAID moved rapidly,\" targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene Wednesday night as an appeals court refused to lift the midnight deadline.</p>\n\n<p>Trump administration officials \u2014 after repeated warnings from the federal judge in the case \u2014 also said Wednesday they were finally beginning to send out their first or any payments after more than a month with no known spending. Officials were processing a few million dollars of back payments, officials said, of billions of dollars owed to US and international organizations and companies.</p>",

The daily life of millions of Chileans can't be impacted like this by companies that don't do their job,\" Boric said in a statement issued by his office.</p>\n\n<p>Early Wednesday, \"90 percent of (electricity) consumption was restored\" to homes, the power system's operator said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Senapred disaster response agency, the outage affected an area stretching all the way from Arica in the long, narrow South American country's north to Los Lagos in the south \u2014 an area home to over 90 percent of Chile's 20 million people.</p>\n\n<p>The blackout disrupted transport in the capital Santiago, where thousands were evacuated from the metro and people jostled to board overflowing buses.</p>\n\n<p>President Boric had activated \"a state of emergency due to a catastrophe\" and announced a curfew until 6 a.m. Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Attack ruled out</p>\n\n<p>Interior Minister Carolina Toha ruled out sabotage as the reason for the power loss, which began at 3:16 p.m. in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer.</p>\n\n<p>\"There is no reason to assume that this is an attack,\" she said on Tuesday, telling reporters it was more likely \"a failure in the system's operation.\"</p>\n\n<p>The metro company, which transports 2.3 million passengers every day, said workers were deployed to all stations \"to support safe evacuations.\"</p>\n\n<p>Out-of-service traffic lights caused major gridlock, with some people having to walk for hours under a hot sun to reach their homes.</p>\n\n<p>Shops and offices closed early.</p>\n\n<p>Dramatic rescues</p>\n\n<p>The Chilevision broadcaster showed video of people trapped on a mechanical ride several meters high at an amusement park in Santiago before being rescued.</p>\n\n<p>An AFP photographer saw firefighters rescue a distraught elderly woman, who had been trapped inside an elevator.</p>\n\n<p>The country's hospital system and prisons were operating on emergency generators.</p>\n\n<p>Boric flew over the capital by helicopter to assess the situation.</p>\n\n<p>In the coastal city of Valparaiso, witnesses also reported shops and businesses closing early and traffic chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Chile boasts one of the best power networks in South America and has not had a blackout this big in about 15 years.</p>",

Israel is sending a team right now as we speak,\" Steve Witkoff told an event for the American Jewish Committee.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's either going to be in Doha or in Cairo, where negotiations will begin again with the Egyptians and the Qataris,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>This first phase is supposed to end on Saturday, but negotiations planned for the rest of the process \u2014 which were to begin in early February \u2014 have not started.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has said it is ready to release \"in one go\" all the hostages remaining during the second phase.</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday, the group accused Israel of endangering the Gaza truce by delaying the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners.</p>\n\n<p>'Dignified swaps'</p>\n\n<p>Israel justified the delay by citing concerns over how the hostages have been freed, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing the process as \"humiliating ceremonies.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since the ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 25 Israeli hostages in public ceremonies across Gaza, where masked, armed fighters have escorted the captives onto stages decorated with slogans.</p>\n\n<p>Israel has released over 1,100 Palestinian prisoners.</p>\n\n<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross has urged all parties to carry out prisoner and hostage swaps \"in a dignified and private manner.\"</p>\n\n<p>Given the nature of the deep-rooted Israeli-Palestinian conflict, prisoner releases from Israeli jails are highly controversial.</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, the prisoners are largely viewed as \"terrorists\" for the violent attacks they have carried out against civilians and security forces.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli authorities and much of the public see their imprisonment as a necessary measure to prevent further attacks.</p>\n\n<p>For Palestinians, however, the releases are viewed as long-delayed justice, with the prisoners often regarded as symbols of resistance against the Israeli occupation.</p>\n\n<p>Ceasefire holds</p>\n\n<p>Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, but it has so far held.</p>\n\n<p>Israel vowed to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack, and has made bringing back all hostages seized that day one of its war objectives.</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, hundreds of people attended the funeral Tuesday of hostage Oded Lifshitz, a peace activist and former journalist who died in captivity and whose body was returned last week.</p>\n\n<p>Three other Israelis kidnapped in Nir Oz \u2014 Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two boys, Ariel and Kfir, ages four and eight and a half months respectively \u2014 will be buried on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside the Gaza war \u2014 which displaced almost the enclave's entire population of 2.4 million \u2014 Israel has intensified its military operations in the West Bank.</p>",

But others in the region made strong gains in the index without changing categories \u2014 Bangladesh, where iron-fisted leader Sheikh Hasina fled in the face of a revolt, and Sri Lanka, where Anura Kumara Dissanayake was elected president on an anti-corruption platform after breaking the stranglehold of the two long-dominant parties.</p>\n\n<p>The largest score improvement in the index, which tracks both countries and territories, was in Indian-administered Kashmir, which held elections for the first time since the Hindu nationalist government in New Delhi revoked the Muslim-majority region's special status in 2019.</p>\n\n\nBhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck (center) gestures during his visit to the Hanuman temple during the Maha Kumbh Mela festival in Prayagraj on February 4, 2025.

        "description": "<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Intuitive Machines made history last year as the first private company to put a robot on the Moon, although the triumph was marred by the lander tipping onto its side.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the Houston-based firm is gearing up for a second attempt, determined to achieve a perfect touchdown.</p>\n\n<p>Intuitive Machines' hexagonal-shaped lander, Athena, is set to launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during a window that opens at 7:02 p.m. (0002 GMT) Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, according to an official spaceflight advisory.</p>\n\n<p>If all goes well, it will touch down around March 6 at a spot called the Mons Mouton plateau, a site closer to the lunar south pole than any previously targeted.</p>\n\n<p>Athena carries scientific instruments, including a drill to search for ice beneath the surface and a unique hopping drone named Grace after a famous computer scientist, Grace Hopper. It is designed to traverse the Moon's rugged inclines, boulders, and craters \u2014 a valuable capability to support future crewed missions.</p>\n\n<p>Also aboard is a small rover, which will test a lunar cellular network provided by Nokia Bell Labs by relaying commands, images, and video between the lander, rover, and hopper.</p>\n\n<p>Until recently, soft lunar landings were achieved only by a handful of well-funded national space agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the US is working to make private missions routine through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, a public-private collaboration aimed at delivering key NASA hardware to the surface at a fraction of the cost of traditional missions. The effort supports the broader Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon and apply lessons learned there to prepare for reaching Mars.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is a really sophisticated mission enabled by the partnerships between the government and US industry,\" said Joel Kearns, NASA's deputy associate administrator for exploration.</p>\n\n\nThis February 19, 2025, image courtesy of Intuitive Machines, LLC shows the company's IM-2 mission Nova-C class lunar lander, Athena, encapsulated within SpaceX's payload fairing in preparation for launch, at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. AFP PHOTO / INTUITIVE MACHINES, LLC\n\n\n<p>Nailing the landing</p>\n\n<p>The first major hurdle, however, will be achieving a perfect landing \u2014 a feat the company fell short of with its first lander, Odysseus, which went to space in February 2024. It caught a foot on the surface and tipped over, coming to rest at a 30-degree angle \u2014 limiting its solar power and preventing it from completing NASA experiments under a $118 million contract.</p>\n\n<p>This time, the price tag is $62.5 million.</p>\n\n<p>\"Landing on the Moon is very challenging,\" said Kearns. \"It's a lot tougher than landing on Earth, where we have the advantage of air, wings, parachutes, and things like that.\"</p>\n\n<p>But on the Moon, which has an atmosphere so thin it's practically a vacuum, spacecraft must rely solely on controlled bursts from thrusters to slow their descent.</p>\n\n<p>Intuitive Machines CEO Trent Martin acknowledged the challenges and said the company had made key improvements \u2014 including better cabling for the laser altimeter, an instrument that provides altitude and velocity readings and helps select a safe landing site.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue the IM-1 mission faced was accurately determining its position en route to the Moon. To improve this, Intuitive Machines has enhanced coordination with NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) for more precise navigation.</p>\n\n<p>Athena's arrival at the Moon is set to be preceded on March 2 by another private US lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, which launched on a more circuitous journey back in January, sharing a ride with Tokyo-based ispace's Resilience lander.</p>\n\n<p>Also hitching a ride on this rocket will be NASA's Lunar Trailblazer probe, which will enter orbit after a four-month journey and begin a two-year mission to study the distribution of different forms of water on the Moon.</p>\n\n<p>These missions come at a delicate time for NASA, amid speculation that it may scale back or cancel its astronaut program to the Moon in favor of Mars \u2014 a key goal of both President Donald Trump and his close advisor Elon Musk.</p>",

Let it become a choral prayer, (to) give Pope Francis health, strength, give him the ability to face this moment too, as he has always done\", Reina said.</p>\n\n<p>'Breath of fresh air' </p>\n\n<p>In Buenos Aires, where the former Jorge Bergoglio served as archbishop before being made pope in 2013, hundreds of Argentines prayed for the pontiff.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking in the plaza where Bergoglio used to rail against injustice and inequality, Archbishop Jorge Garcia Cuerva called Francis's papacy \"a breath of oxygen for a world suffocated by violence, suffocated by selfishness, suffocated by exclusion\".</p>\n\n<p>\"Let our prayer be that breath of fresh air that reaches his lungs so that he can recover his health,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Honduran Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, a former coordinator of the pope's Council of Cardinals, told La Repubblica daily Tuesday he felt hopeful the pope would pull through.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's not yet time for him to go to heaven,\" Maradiaga said.</p>\n\n<p>\"He is someone who does not back down in the face of difficulty, does not get discouraged, does not freeze, and does not stop moving forward,\" he told the paper.</p>\n\n<p>Recovery time </p>\n\n<p>Doctors have cautioned that any recovery will take time and that Francis will likely stay in hospital beyond this week.</p>\n\n<p>The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has increasingly suffered health complications in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>He is prone to respiratory infections, is overweight and suffers knee and hip pain that has led to his reliance on a wheelchair.</p>\n\n<p>It takes a young person at least two weeks to get over double pneumonia, Massimo Andreoni, scientific director of the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, told newspaper La Stampa.</p>\n\n<p>\"For an older person like Pope Francis, with all the added complications... you have to wait even longer for a complete recovery,\" Andreoni said.</p>",

        "description": "<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Roughly a third of staffers at Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have resigned in protest, saying that they will not push through demanded changes that put the country at risk.</p>\n\n<p>\"We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,\" 21 staffers of DOGE wrote in a letter, seen by AFP on Tuesday, to White House chief of staff Susan Wiles.</p>\n\n<p>\"However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments,\" they added.</p>\n\n<p>The workers initially worked for the United States Digital Service, which was transformed into DOGE after President Donald Trump took office on January 20th, with Musk effectively taking over the department.</p>\n\n<p>Musk is the political force behind DOGE, with a small group of employees faithful to the multi-billionaire being dispatched across government and working toward gutting federal staffing and spending.</p>\n\n<p>While Musk is not the formal administrator of DOGE, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO is nonetheless directing operations and will even attend Trump's first cabinet meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>The world's wealthiest person and a top Trump donor, Musk has no ministerial portfolio or formal decision-making authority but has status as a \"special government employee\" and \"senior adviser to the president.\"</p>\n\n<p>He downplayed the significance of the departures, saying that the workers were \"political holdovers\" who worked remotely and refused to return to the office as ordered by Trump.</p>\n\n<p>\"They would have been fired had they not resigned,\" he added on X, the platform he owns.</p>\n\n<p>The signatories describe a chaotic transition process that began on January 21 with hastily conducted interviews by unidentified individuals wearing White House visitor badges.</p>\n\n<p>The interviewers questioned staff about political loyalty, attempted to create division among team members, and displayed \"limited technical ability.\"</p>\n\n<p>Tensions escalated on February 14 when approximately one-third of USDS staff were abruptly terminated via anonymous email.</p>\n\n<p>The dismissed employees had been working on modernizing critical government systems including Social Security, veterans' services, tax filing, healthcare, and disaster relief platforms, the letter said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and Americans' data less safe,\" the letter stated.</p>\n\n<p>The employees explicitly refused to participate in what they described as efforts to \"compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.\"</p>\n\n<p>Software for firing </p>\n\n<p>The USDS was established in 2014 during Barack Obama's administration and has historically operated as a non-partisan technology unit tasked with improving government digital services.</p>\n\n<p>The mass resignation came days after Musk engineered a mass email to the federal government's two million workers, ordering them to justify their work in an email or risk being fired.</p>\n\n<p>Government departments on Monday largely told staff to either ignore the DOGE-inspired email or downplayed the risks of not answering it.</p>\n\n<p>According to Wired magazine, engineers at DOGE are working on new software that could assist mass firings of federal workers across the government.</p>\n\n<p>So far, thousands of mainly probationary workers -- employees who are recently hired, promoted, or otherwise changed roles -- have been terminated since Trump's inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>The new software would streamline the dismissal process, known as a reduction in force, for firing federal workers with stronger civil service protections.</p>",
